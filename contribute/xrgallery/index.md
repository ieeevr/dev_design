    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The desire to replicate reality has been a long-lasting human endeavor. Images of the earliest cave drawings communicated about the important aspects of life at the beginning of human civilization. Paintings and sculptures aspired to capture the natural proportions and beauty of human form as well as spirit, while cinema made the static images move and accompany them with sound. In the late 20th century, the unprecedented speed in digital developments enabled the creation of three-dimensional worlds, which did not only surround the user, but also respond to their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, we are witnessing a rapid rise of artificial intelligence, conversational agents, and creative machines, the way reality is perceived is going through an unprecedented transformation. While offering immense creative possibilities, those tools also pose significant challenges by blurring the lines between fact and fiction, truth and fabrication. This digital storm is reshaping our relationship to facts and history, confronting our definition of reality, plausibility and realism.

    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">TOPICS and SCOPE</h2>
    <p>
        As part IEEE VR 2025, we are delighted to invite you to the first edition of the ‘XR Gallery’ fostering bridges between people from the XR and Art communities through this art exhibition, titled "Edges of Reality: Questioning the Truthfulness of our Digital Realities". We aim to provoke creative thought and discussion between artists and researchers around the question of authenticity and truthfulness of digital experiences. By bridging the gap between the XR research community and the art world, we hope to inspire innovative perspectives and foster a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between technology and reality.
       
        Some of the potential questions which can be explored in this respect are: 
        <ul>
            <li>How do scientific and technological advances confront and alter our common senses, changing our own perception of reality and of what is possible to imagine</li>
            <li>Does my behavior change in a plausible simulated environment?</li>
            <li>Can a software that behaves indistinguishably from a human be considered truly real?</li>
            <li>What distinguishes our actual self from a simulated self constructed from our digital traces?</li>
            <li>What would be the implication of a faithful simulation of an ancestor based solely on their private diaries or literary correspondence? </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>


        The exhibition will primarily focus on interactive XR art installations, while also welcoming non-XR art installations, such as performances or any other digital media questioning the nature of reality in our increasingly digital world. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Accepted submission will be showcased at the dedicated space for the XR Gallery during the entire duration of the IEEEVR conference, excluding the days of workshops <strong>(March 8-12 2025, Saint-Malo, France)</strong>. Discussions are underway to arrange a public exhibition in the days following the conference.
