    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Doctoral Consortium at IEEE VR 2025 is a concentrated event where students present their research interests, plans, and results to a panel of researchers in related fields and receive specific and constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive valuable comments from mentors and peers. Additionally, accepted students will have the chance to create a poster about their work to allow IEEE VR 2025 attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each other’s work. These posters will also be shown to the broader audience during the conference poster session. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the IEEE VR 2025 online program. Abstracts may be archived in the IEEExplore digital library.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Eligibility-and-topics">Eligibility and Topics</h2>
    <p>
        Ideal candidates will be in the early or mid-stage of their PhD and should have a solid idea of their research direction as well as dissertation topic, which may still have room for improvement. The consortium welcomes applicants from a broad range of disciplines conducting research related to Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces including VR, MR, AR, 3D user interfaces, human-computer interaction, wearable computing, social informatics, information technology, cognitive science, and related fields.
