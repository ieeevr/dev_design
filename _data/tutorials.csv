T1,Tutorial 1,XR for Healthcare: Immersive and Interactive Technologies for Serious Games (HealthXR),"Manuela Chessa, Fabio Solari","Saturday,&nbsp;March&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2024",8:30,12:00,"Orlando,&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;USA&nbsp;UTC-4","Fantasia&nbsp;M","<span class='bold'>Manuela Chessa</span> - <i>University of Genoa - Dept. of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics, and Systems Engineering</i>|<span class='bold'>Fabio Solari</span> - <i>University of Genoa - Dept. of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics, and Systems Engineering</i>","In this tutorial, we will present and discuss the challenges of exploiting novel XR technologies in the field of healthcare, specifically to develop serious games and exercises for a wide range of cognitive and physical issues, ranging from training to assessment. In such a domain, VR experts should collaborate and work in synergy with doctors, physiotherapists, and healthcare specialists. Though the interest in XR applications in healthcare has recently gained popularity, a big gap between the technological advances in VR and 3D technologies and their effective use in clinical practice still exists. Indeed, XR setups adopted by hospitals and rehabilitation centers seldom exploit the more recent VR/AR/MR solutions. On the other hand, VR/AR/MR researchers still pay little attention to the cognitive, perceptual, and physical specificity of patients and users affected by specific disabilities and impairments.|In this tutorial, Manuela Chessa and Fabio Solari will exploit their expertise in the development of VR and AR solutions, with specific attention to cognitive and perceptual aspects, and their expertise coming from a longtime collaboration in international projects addressing healthcare issues.|The aim of the tutorial is to revise the theoretical backgrounds of VR development, to present and discuss the opportunities and the limits of current technologies and software solutions, and to focus on the existing gaps between VR communities and healthcare ones.|During the tutorial, the presenters will share examples from their collaborations with hospitals and research centers.|The tutorial is supported by the FIT4MEDROB (PNRR) &quot;Progetto&quot; Fit4MedRob- Fit for Medical Robotics&quot;, Piano Nazionale Complementare (PNC) - Italy.",,"This tutorial is targeted towards both students and academic researchers, as well as people from industry. In general, people involved at various levels in the development of XR systems for cognitive and physical training could be interested in this tutorial.","The audience will learn the perceptual differences between the main visualization and interaction techniques in XR, and how to optimally exploit such differences to develop effective serious games and exergames. The main goal of this tutorial is to teach and discuss the gaps that still prevent the effective use of the latest VR technologies in the field of healthcare.",,

T3,Tutorial 3,New Advances in the Theory and Evaluation of Presence,"Mel Slater, Mavi Sanchez-Vives, Ramon Oliva, Esen K&uuml;&ccedil;&uuml;kt&uuml;t&uuml;nc&uuml;","Sunday,&nbsp;March 17,&nbsp;2023",8:30,12:00,"Orlando,&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;USA&nbsp;UTC-4","Fantasia&nbsp;M","<span class='bold'>Mel Slater</span> - <i>Event Lab, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain & Institute of Neurosciences, University of Barcelona, Spain</i>|<span class='bold'>Mavi Sanchez-Vives</span> - <i>Event Lab, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain</i>|<span class='bold'>Ramon Oliva</span> - <i>Event Lab, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain & Institut d'Investigacions Biom&egrave;diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain|</i><span class='bold'>Esen Küçüktütüncü</span> - <i>Event Lab, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain & Institute of Neurosciences, University of Barcelona, Spain</i>","Presence has been a cornerstone of Virtual Reality (VR) research since the early 1990s, focusing on the phenomena where users experience illusions of being in virtual environments (Place Illusion, PI), believing in the reality of those events (Plausibility Illusion, Psi), feeling ownership over a virtual body, and sensing the presence of others (copresence). This tutorial addresses these aspects and introduces novel evaluation methods. Recent advancements have reshaped our understanding of presence, suggesting PI is based on natural sensorimotor contingencies within VR, Psi depends on the environment's response to user actions and coherence with real-life expectations, and body ownership stems from multisensory integration. The tutorial will explore how presence can now be quantified using probability theory and Reinforcement Learning, bypassing traditional questionnaires and measures. It also highlights an inverse relationship between PI and the entropy of eye scanpaths, providing a solid empirical basis for the study of PI. This tutorial is designed for researchers and practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding of VR's scientific principles, particularly presence. It is beneficial for both research and the design and testing of VR applications, requiring some prior VR experience and ideally, a grasp of experimental design and analysis. Participants will learn the conceptual framework of presence and its evaluation through lectures and practical experiences, including multi-participant environments from the GuestXR European Project. This hands-on approach will demonstrate how various factors, like sensorimotor contingencies, affect presence in settings such as multi-person meetings. Attendees will gain a comprehensive theoretical understanding of presence and insights into assessing contributing and detracting factors, including experimental design and evaluation.",,"This tutorial is aimed at researchers and practitioners who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the scientific basis of virtual reality with respect to the issue of presence. This will be useful for research, but also for the design and testing of applications. Participants should ideally have had some prior experience of VR. Some understanding of experimental design and analysis would be useful, but not essential.","The audience will learn about the conceptual framework of presence and about how to evaluate it for experimental studies or practical implementations. Moreover, they would learn this not only through lectures but through some actual experiences making use of multi-participant environments developed in the GuestXR European Project. These experiences will show, in a practical way, how varying contributing factors (such as the sensorimotor contingencies) influence the illusions of presence, for example, in multi-person meetings. The audience is expected therefore to take away a deeper theoretical appreciation of the long-standing issues of presence and be able judge how to assess the factors that lead to and detract from it, including the issue of experimental design and evaluation.",,

Applications of IA techniques offer several opportunities over traditional data visualization techniques such as spatial immersion, multi-sensory presentation, situated visualization, engagement, and collaboration. However, with additional opportunities come additional challenges. IA systems and visualizations comprise a vast and nascent design space that span different display technologies, input modalities, hardware systems, interactions, and visualization design practices. These dimensions make it challenging for researchers and developers to design and implement IA visualizations and systems.|Beyond developing effective IA systems, the challenge of creating collaborative immersive applications is daunting. Implementing data synchronization of interactive elements of the environment, sharing synchronized avatars and presence, and voice and/or video sharing represents a non-trivial engineering feat for most developers. This is especially challenging in education and research environments where resources are limited.|The main goal of this course is to equip researchers to face these challenges by familiarizing them with the development of immersive and collaborative visualizations with web technology, and giving them a practical starting point for creating their own applications and environments.",,
