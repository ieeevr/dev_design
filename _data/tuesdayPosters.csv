The avatar had little to no impact on efficiency and surprisingly lowered overall accuracy in both the 2D plane and depth. However, the avatar also reduced variability in depth selection. Avatar design and specific MR hardware parameters may significantly impact efficiency, especially compared to VR devices."

The objective is to swiftly update the current state of the field since, in most cases, incorporating such amendments is not feasible during the reconstruction of virtual environments. This changing speed is very important for critical systems. Preliminary results demonstrate successful updating rates, enabling engineers to make rapid decisions. It is expected that the proposed methodology can improve the efficiency and dependability of step-by-step activities, while also reducing the time and costs associated with system maintenance."

A guide system, featuring two distinct audiovisual guide representations—a human agent guide and a symbol-based guide—was developed and evaluated through a preliminary user study. The results do not show significant differences between the two guide conditions, but offer insight into the user-perceived confidence and enjoyment of the real-world navigation task after experiencing the route in immersive virtual reality. We discuss the results and direction of future research."

The goal of this research was to develop 14 racially diverse androgynous avatars using the design guidelines recommended in prior work. However, a perceptual experiment involving 68 participants revealed unexpected results, as most avatars were perceived as predominantly masculine. Additionally, our results yielded discrepancies in perceived gender across different racial identities, as the same design process resulted in widely varying perceptions. Despite these challenges, our research highlights the importance of continued exploration to improve the creation of inclusive avatars."

This experiment investigates how avatar mimicry in online interactions influences creativity. Participants were divided into Mimic and Original conditions, participating in brainstorming tasks, notably the creative tasks such as the Alternative Uses Task. The study assesses the quality of ideas generated—focusing on Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration, and Originality—and participant impressions of their avatars. Our findings suggest significant implications for enhancing creativity in virtual settings, providing insights into the future of collaborative innovation in the metaverse."

In a factorial between-groups design, 122 individuals with elevated paranoia experienced a virtual lift ride with virtual humans that varied in facial animation (static or animated) and expression (neutral or positive). Facial animation (p=0.053) led to a significant reduction in co-presence. Positive expressions (p-adj=0.046) significantly decreased the visual attention to virtual humans when their faces were static. Our results indicate that virtual human programming could influence user perception and visual behaviours for people with mistrust."

The system uses the cameras of the headset to recognize objects and their positions in real time. It constructs a model to predict: (i) the task being completed, (ii) the step of the task they are on, and (iii) whether they have made any errors. By updating this model in real-time as the user completes the task, the system automatically updates the instructions and cues provided to the user. This system represents a step towards ubiquitous task guidance via AR"

Nevertheless, the knowledge in designing virtual environments and their influence on products is limited in literature. Common “brick and mortar” virtualization of shops as realistic digital twin is a reductive approach compared to more creative experiences. This work explores novel paradigms by evaluating “anomalous environments” deviated from the ordinary conception. Different anomalies are evaluated within 8 scenes promoting an existing line of futuristiclooking tracksuits. The experimentation on 42 subjects, shows that anomalous environments, especially when aligned with the product's storytelling, can increase products likeability, interest and perceived valorization."

Though state-of-the art algorithms have enabled sub-degree accuracy for line-of-sight tracking, one remaining problem is that depth tracking, i.e. calculation of the gaze intersection at various depths, is still inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a 3D calibration method that accounts for gaze depth in addition to line-of-sight. By taking advantage of 3D calibration points and modeling the relationship between gaze inaccuracy and depth, we show that we can improve depth calculations and better determine the 3D position of gaze intersections in virtual environments."

Therefore, we developed a 3-minute HMD VR program to educate patients about the importance of exercise. The control group (n=30) received usual care, while the experimental group (n=30) experienced virtual reality and assessed SSQ and exercise intention. No patients experienced VR sickness and the experimental group had a statistically significant higher intention to exercise for diabetes management. Older adults found the VR experience exciting and novel. For diabetic foot experience, color change is enough to motivate them."

This study explores how virtual characters impact motivation for well-being. Three prototypes with cartoon, robotic, and human-like avatars were tested by 22 participants. Results show that animated virtual avatars, especially with extended reality, boost motivation, enhance comprehension of activities, and heighten presence. Multiple output modalities, like audio and text, with character animations, improve the user experience. Notably, the cartoon-like character evoked positive responses. This research highlights virtual characters' potential to engage individuals in daily well-being activities."

To achieve this, we partition the input mesh using geometric features, and each part is converted to a primitive to minimize the surface deviation. Storing each primitive into a leaf node of the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), our system achieves more than 90% of model reduction and interactive rendering performance for several plant models."

Rapidly distinguishing between benign causes and more severe conditions requires performing and interpreting a three-step bedside head and eye movement assessment known as HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew). A shortage of experts trained in conducting and interpreting this test exists. Consequently, we developed TeleAutoHINTS, comprising (1) a Hololens2-based head and eye tracking platform for automated tele-sensing and (2) an interconnected interface for visualization and analysis. We tested and evaluated TeleAutoHINTS on three subjects."
