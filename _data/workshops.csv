1,WISP,5th Workshop on Immersive Sickness Prevention,"Saturday, 16 March 2024",13:30,17:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","The Workshop on Immersive Sickness Prevention is intended to foster discussion between researchers, developers, and practitioners interested in addressing cybersickness, one of the most significant usability issues in the virtual reality field. Although immersive technologies have been advancing rapidly, their rate of public adoption has been slowed by the fact that many users experience physical discomfort during or after the use of VR devices, with symptomatic characteristics similar to motion sickness. Furthermore, studies have consistently shown that motion sickness disproportionately affects women, and concerns have been raised about the existence of inequitable barriers for engaging with immersive media. The workshop program will include primary research papers that report study results, novel interaction techniques, or technological interventions aimed towards understanding and mitigating cybersickness, as well as position papers describing early-stage concepts, preliminary results, or case studies from industry.",Isayas Adhanom,https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/wisp,Fantasia C
2,NIDIT,Workshop on Novel Input Devices and Interaction Techniques,"Sunday, 17 March 2024",8:00,17:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Recent advances in VR display technologies have led to high-resolution, ergonomic, and - critically - low-cost head-mounted displays (HMDs). Advances in commercial input devices and interaction techniques have arguably not kept pace with these advances in display systems. For instance, most HMDs include tracked input devices, but these ""controllers"" are still fairly similar to the earliest examples of 3D controllers used in the 1980s. Interaction in commercial VR systems has similarly lagged; despite many advances in 3D interaction in the past three decades of VR research, interaction in commercial systems largely relies on classical techniques. This full-day workshop will bring together researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and experience the future of input devices for Virtual/Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality and 3D User Interfaces and help chart a course for the future of 3D interaction techniques. We invite authors to submit 4-6 page papers and of all accepted submissions are strongly encouraged to demonstrate their novel input device and interaction techniques in an interactive demo format following their presentation.",Anil Batmaz,https://sites.google.com/view/nidit,Fantasia B
3,VHCIE,8th Workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments,"Saturday, 16 March 2024",13:30,17:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Today, many tools, are available to design believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments, interacting with each other and with users. A wide range of applications can be envisioned, ranging from virtual tour to the creation of virtual platforms for training or studying human behavior, or even the reproduction of a concert. However, several challenges are still open concerning the multimodal representation of interactions, the responsiveness of virtual humans to the user at the verbal and non-verbal communication levels, or the understanding of the impact of individual and situational factors in social interactions in populated environments. The goal of the VHCIE workshop is to generate discussions on the latest research related to these issues in a cross-community approach. VHCIE 2024 also aims to be more inclusive, giving students the opportunity to present their ongoing projects and questions in an informal mentoring session.",Anne-Hélène Olivier,http://files.inria.fr/vhcie/2024,Fantasia A

7,AVR,Archiving VR,"Sunday, 17 March 2024",13:30,17:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Virtual reality is already over 50 years old. While consumers are now appreciating modern devices that are easy to use, this workshop will celebrate some of the pioneering work that brought us to this point. We are interested in demonstrating, and starting to archive in more detail, not just the hardware, but the experiences that older VR systems presented. Thus, while one can see pictures of old, often cumbersome, head-mounted displays, we feel that there is a need to preserve video, or ideally immersive experiences, of these systems to convey the trajectory of research. That is, we want to explore what was engaging about these immersive experiences, and why they inspired such a wide variety of research and media interest. The goal of the workshop is thus to bring together people interested in the problem of preserving the best possible media about these systems.",Anthony Steed,https://sites.google.com/view/archivingvr2024/,Fantasia C

Such avatars may also be called dissimilar avatars as they differ from users' real bodies by either subtle modifications (e.g., another body proportion) or more extreme body changes (e.g., robot, animal, etc.). Their diverse applications range from the film industry to environmental purposes. However, the study of dissimilar avatars is a complex multidisciplinary topic and a lot of challenges remain to be overcome to fully take advantage of their benefits (lack a common understanding, complex algorithms for animation, multisensory feedback, difficulties to provide a Sense of Embodiment, etc.). The goal of PANDAS is to present state-of-the-art research on dissimilar avatars, show examples of control/perception/interaction/animation with such bodies, and discuss future work and requirements for improving and developing new types of avatars.",Rebecca Fribourg,https://sites.google.com/view/ieee-vr-24-pandas,Fantasia F
