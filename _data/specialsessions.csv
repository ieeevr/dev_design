SS1,"Putting DEIA in our DNA","<strong>Dylan Fox</strong>: <i>XR Access, USA</i> (Moderator) with <strong>Aleshia Hayes</strong>: <i>University of North Texas, USA</i>, <strong>John Quarles</strong>: <i>University of Texas at San Antonio, USA</i>, and <strong>Missie Smith</strong>: <i>Meta Reality Labs, USA</i>","Monday, 18 March 2024",11:30,12:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Many people in the XR research community agree on the need for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) as important ethical principles and mechanisms to create a more innovative, powerful, and unbiased research environment. While good people work hard on incorporating DEIA initiatives into our regular conferences, e.g., IEEE VR and ISMAR, the efforts tend to be episodic and focused only on the single event. Join this year’s DEIA Chairs for a community discussion about the issues, and some ideas for more strategic, sustainable, and robust pathways that leverage the intelligence, creativity, and energy of all potential researchers and practitioners, while also leading to more equitable, inclusive, and accessible work spaces and research environments.",Fantasia Ballroom H
SS2,"The Reviewing Crisis","<strong>Tabitha Peck</strong>: <i>Davidson College, USA</i> (Moderator) with <strong>Bobby Bodenheimer</strong>: <i>Vanderbilt University, USA</i>, <strong>Vicki Interrante</strong>: <i>University of Minnesota, USA</i>, <strong>Maud Marchal</strong>: <i>University of Rennes, France</i>, <strong>Anthony Steed</strong>: <i>University College London, UK</i>, and <strong>Evan Suma Rosenberg</strong>: <i>University of Minnesota, USA</i>","Tuesday, 19 March 2024",11:30,12:30,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Anyone who submits a manuscript for peer review wants the review to be carried out by experts who are thoughtful, fair, and constructive. And yet it would be safe to bet that most peer reviewers feel completely overloaded with review requests from both humans and automated systems, for a wide range of venues including conferences, journals, and research proposals. As researchers we want even more opportunities for publication, for impact and professional development, and yet each new venue adds yet another source of review requests. Further, as the demand continues to increase, the time most of us can spend on voluntary reviews continues to shrink as our lives and institutions add more inescapable demands. Our current reviewing models are unsustainable, let alone able to support growth. Join a group of established researchers who have significant experience on both sides of the equation to discuss the difficulties and explore ideas for new approaches — including radical new approaches — that might be sustainable and accommodate growth.",Fantasia Ballroom H
SS3,"Archiving VR","<strong>Anthony Steed</strong>: <i>University College London, UK</i> (Moderator) with <strong>Carolina Cruz-Neira</strong>: <i>University of Central Florida, USA</i> and <strong>Jeremy Dalton</strong>: <i>PwC, USA</i>","Wednesday, 20 March 2024",15:30,16:15,"Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4","Virtual reality is already over 50 years old. While consumers are now appreciating modern devices that are relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and reliable, there is a long history of pioneering work that brought us to this point. On Sunday we held a VR 2024 workshop to begin an effort to gather and share information about some of the seminal systems, to demonstrate some of them, and to share stories. Join us for a summary of the workshop, including what was engaging about these immersive experiences, and why they inspired such a wide variety of research and media interest. We will also discuss how we might move forward to preserve the historical artifacts and the stories for the VR community at large.",Fantasia Ballroom H
